# linter-explorer - WiP, don't use it as-is
Live demo of multiple Python linters, all configurable and running in your browser, to help you pick the one which fits you the most

## TODO Ideas
- Make it configurable so you can limit the number of available linters / options, and set the CSS and the logo?
  - Would make a reusable project for any dev that want to show his config
- Just allow to pass all parameters through url, so you can link here instead
- Encourage the addition of more linters through PR

- [Jos√© Padilla](https://github.com/jpadilla) for the initial [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) [demo website](https://black.vercel.app/), from which most of this project was scaffolded (it uses a serverless backend while this project uses [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/))
